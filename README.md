# A2 Genetic Algorithms

# Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Group Members: Emily, Ari


Any peers and/or TAs/Tutors you collaborated with: Rachel, Huda, Emily, Zoe F


Would you like to give "kudos" to anyone who was particularly supportive or helpful? 

    - Rachel and I ended up working together a lot. She really helped me figure out a lot of the individual class. I also worked with Huda on figuring out the fitness score method. I also went to TA hours which helped.


Cite any references used: None


Brief summary of what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?

    - I found it interesting to note that the more times the simulation was run, the more likely it was to get a generation that had a shorter chromosome and started+ended with the same letter. Changing the parameter values did have an effect on what I observed, but the most noticable parameter change was changing the amount of times the simulation was run.


Reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?

    - I thought it was interesting to observe how the generations changed throughout the simulation. I also thought it was interesting to see how much java I understood/was able to write after not having writing java in a while. I thought this assignment was certainly challenging because I had to think through all of the different steps logically and then figure out how I wanted to apply that to an actual application, but I feel like I learned a lot about my own thought process and methods for turning my ideas into functioning code. I also thought it was a good assignment because it got me thinking logically through all of the different steps. I thought the assignment was a bit challenging because there were so many steps, and it sometimes made it difficult to progress if I got stuck on a step since so much of the code relied on other parts. Talking through ideas with my peers as well as trying out different ideas/lots of trial and error/debugging helped me get through parts I was stuck on, however.
